To design a one-server web infrastructure that hosts the website reachable vi
a www.foobar.com, let's start with a user wanting to access your website.
Here is an outline of the infrastructure components and their roles:



1. Server: A server is a computer system that provides services to other
computers, known as clients, over a network. In this case, it refers to the
physical machine that hosts all the required components of your web
infrastructure.

2. Domain Name: The domain name, in this case, foobar.com, serves as a human-
readable address for your website. It allows users to access your website by
typing "www.foobar.com" into their web browsers. The domain name system (DNS)
translates the domain name into an IP address.

3. DNS Record: The "www" record in www.foobar.com is a DNS record called a CNAME
(Canonical Name) record. It points the www subdomain to the IP address of your
server (in this case, 8.8.8.8).

4. Web Server (Nginx): The web server is responsible for handling HTTP requests
and serving web content to clients. In this infrastructure, Nginx is used as the
web server software. It listens for incoming requests on port 80 (HTTP) or 443
(HTTPS), processes those requests, and returns the appropriate web pages or
resources to the user's browser.

5. Application Server: The application server hosts your application codebase.
It is responsible for processing dynamic requests generated by the user,
executing the necessary code, interacting with databases, and generating dynamic
content to be served by the web server. In this infrastructure, the application
server runs alongside the web server on the same server machine.

6. Application Files: These are the code files that make up your website or web
application. The application files contain the logic, functionality, and content
required to generate the web pages dynamically. The application server executes
these files to generate the appropriate responses for user requests.

7. Database (MySQL): The database is a crucial component for storing and
retrieving structured data used by your application. In this infrastructure,
MySQL is used as the database management system. It allows you to store and
manage the website's data efficiently, such as user information, content, and
various application-related data.

8. Communication with User's Computer: When a user requests your website by
typing www.foobar.com into their browser, their computer sends an HTTP request
over the internet. The request travels through the network infrastructure and
reaches the server hosting your website. The web server on the server processes
the request and sends back an HTTP response containing the requested web page or
resource. The user's browser then renders the received content and displays it
to the user.

Now, let's discuss the issues with this infrastructure:

1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF): Since this infrastructure relies on a single
server, it becomes a single point of failure. If the server experiences any
hardware or software failures, the entire website becomes inaccessible. This
creates a risk of downtime and potential loss of user traffic.

2. Downtime during Maintenance: When performing maintenance tasks, such as
deploying new code or updating server configurations, the web server needs to be
restarted. During this restart period, the website may experience downtime,
resulting in unavailability for users.

3. Limited Scalability: With only one server, this infrastructure cannot handle
a significant increase in incoming traffic. If the website receives a surge of
visitors, the server may become overloaded, resulting in slow response times or
even crashes. This limitation prevents seamless scalability to accommodate
growing user demands.

To address these issues, you could consider implementing a more robust
infrastructure with redundant servers, load balancing, and scalable
architecture. Such improvements would enhance reliability, reduce downtime, and
allow your website to handle increased traffic effectively.
